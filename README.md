# Melvor Idle Mod Locked Out
## Introduction
This is a mod for Melvor Idle. The Goal of this mod is to make a new gamemode (similar to how HCCO is different from hardcore)

## How it Works

At the early game it starts simple:
All skills are locked except Woodcutting (plans to change this in settings for mod later to let users decide their first Skill)
To unlock other skills you must first Level the previously unlocked skill to level 10
all other previously unlocked mods must be multiples of 10 increasing in order of unlock
As you progress and get to levels higher than 120 you must start maxing out items in each skill
For Example:




## Examples

### Early Example:

You have Woodcutting Lvl:10
and Firemaking Lvl:1
If you want to unlock any other skill
you must get Woodcutting to Lvl:20
and also get Firemaking to Lvl:10

### Late Example:

You've been unlocking all non-combat skills in order of the side-bar(Wood,Fish,Fire,Cook,etc.)
To unlock the 14th Skill (in this case Summoning
The Following must be True
Agility Lvl: 10
Herblore Lvl: 20
Runecrafting Lvl: 30
etc etc.
Fishing Lvl:120
Woodcutting Lvl:120 & any one Type of Wood Mastery Lvl:99

## Be Warned:

I'm a slow coder and there is a chance I might never finish this and/or never touch it again before/after finishing it.
